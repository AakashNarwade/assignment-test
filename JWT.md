JWT benefits

1.	JWTs are a standardized container format to encode user and client related information in a secure way using "claims" (whereas cookie contents and signing/encryption are not standardized)
2.	JWTs are not restricted to present session-like information about the authenticated user itself; they can also be used to delegate access to clients that act on behalf of the user
3.	JWTs allow for a more granular access model than cookies because JWTs can be limited in "scope" (what they allow the client to do) as well as time
